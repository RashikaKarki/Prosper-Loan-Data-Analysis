## Dataset


### Investigation Overview

In this analysis I investigated the features that influences borrowers rate, where I explored 10 variables, I found some insights that were really interesting which I can included in the slide.
Dataset Overview

The loan data from Prosper comprise 113,937 entries of loans with 81 different columns. This dataset has alot of information but in this analysis, we will be solely focusing on everything related to loan.

The description of each column can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0).



## Key Insights and summary of findings

- The year has a very strong correlation with borrower debt.
- The group of homeowners have a smaller median borrower rate (approximately 0.2) compared to the non-homeowners (around 0.18) which makes sense as borrowers who can offer a home have a lower risk premium. So, The borrowers who owns a home tends to have less borrower rate than those who does not have house.
- Borrower rate tends to increase with terms.
- The median borrower rate tends to decrease with the number of recommendations. 
- The frequency reduces rapidly over the first five loan categories.1 which is "Debt Consolidation" has the highest frequency followed by 0 which is "Not Available" , 7 which is other, 2 which is Home Improvement, 3 which is Business which is more than 80% of the total data.
- The higher the loan amount the lesser is the borrower rate.

>So, after looking at all these insights we can see that year, homeowning status,loan amount, recommendations, loan categories and terms seems to influence the borrower rate.
